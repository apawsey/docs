bigNEON Platform Overview
=========================== 

bigNEON is the first mobile-centric ticketing platform that combines the primary and secondary markets using blockchain technology. This platform will be open sourced so that anyone can launch a ticketing platform on the blockchain.

## Event Ticketing

bigNEON makes it easy for anyone to create, manage, sell, and verify tickets to events in a secure and scalable way. While ticket records do exist in the bigNEON platform database, the actual digital ticket asset that event attendees own resides on, and is secured by, a blockchain protocol specifically designed to manage digital assets like tickets at scale. This protocol ensures rules set by ticket sellers are adhered to, and risk of fraud is mitigated, while simultaneously enabling a more open secondary market experience that benefits all parties involved. 

## Event Marketing

bigNEON helps anyone market their events by providing automated tools, integrations and APIs for event promoters to easily drive awareness across a variety of channels.

## Event Monitoring and Reporting

bigNEON provides real-time event statistics including sales, attendence, visibility, and more.

Platforms/Interfaces
===========================

 - iOS Native Client `full consumer experience`, `venue scanning/check-in`
 - Android Native Client `full consumer experience`, `venue scanning/check-in`
 - Responsive Web Client `consumer marketing`, `full admin experience`
 - API `all client experiences`, `read-only event api`

Native applications for iOS and Android devices will be developed to provide consumers with the full event discovery, ticket purchasing, ticket transferring/selling and event attendance experience. There must also be a mobile experience for venue operaters to scan and verify tickets as legitimate. It is to be determined if these consumer and operator experiences will exist in the same application, or seperate applications.

A responsive web interface must be developed for any visitor who navigates to the platform via a desktop or mobile web browser. There must be a full organization and event management experience available on the web for Organization Owners and Members. For consumers, the web experience will ultimately drive users to install the native applications where they will be able to purchase tickets to events.

An API must be developed to power these cross-platform client experiences. A read-only version of this API must be accessible to so that organizations/venues/promoters can display their events on their 3rd party websites. Intgrations with popular CMS platforms will be developed.
